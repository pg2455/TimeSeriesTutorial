    "# Time Series Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Time series data is ubiquitous across various real-world scenarios, such as traffic flow, weather patterns, and economic indicators. Multiple methods have been developed, addressing tasks such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Forecasting:** Predict future events based on historical time series data.\n",
    "- **Anomaly Detection:** Spot unusual patterns that deviate from expected behavior.\n",
    "- **Clustering:** Categorize similar time series.\n",
    "- **Classification:** Assign time series data to predefined classes.\n",
    "- **Segmentation:** Break down a time series into meaningful segments.\n",
    "- **Change Point Detection:** Determine points at which the statistical properties of the series shift significantly.\n",
    "- **Causality Analysis:** Use techniques like Granger causality to discover relationships between different time series.\n",
    "- **Dimensionality Reduction:** Apply methods such as Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) to reduce the complexity of time series data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives of This Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial series is designed to guide software and machine learning engineers through the foundational and advanced techniques of time series analysis. By the end of this series, you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Be acquainted with common time series datasets and understand how to manipulate them to develop robust forecasting models.\n",
    "- Explore how to utilize the GluonTS library for loading and modeling custom time series datasets.\n",
    "- Gain practical skills in exploring and visualizing time series data to discern underlying patterns and processes, which will inform your forecasting strategies.\n",
    "- Learn to implement classical forecasting models using the `statsmodels` package, focusing on ARIMA and Exponential Smoothing techniques.\n",
    "- Progress from classical forecasting techniques to advanced, deep learning-based methods, using real-world datasets like the Weekly Exchange Rate.\n",
    "\n",
